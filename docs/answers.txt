5.4 
- Branches let developers work on new features or fixes without affecting the main code
- It makes it easier to integrate work from different people later.

5.5
- git log lists past commits and their details
- git status shows what any changes in the working directory since the last commit.

5.6 
git log --follow Vehicle.h

5.7
git log --grep="file"

5.8
- Inheritance: one class reuses or extends another class' code.
- Polymorphism: objects share a common interface but behave differently.
- Encapsulation: internal data and shows only what’s necessary.

5.9 
- The Integration Manager workflow has one person handling merges from everyone’s (public) repos into the main repo
- The Dictator & Lieutenants model is more spread out (lieutenants deal with groups of developers while the dictator integrates everything into the central repo.

5.10
With 100 developers, the Dictator & Lieutenants workflow "bottlenecks," so it's more organized.
So, each lieutenant works with a smaller set of merges, conflicts, etc. before passing it up to the dictator.
